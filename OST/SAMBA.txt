Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, originally
developed by Andrew Tridgell. As of version 3, Samba provides file and print services for
various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows Server domain, either as
a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or as a domain member. It can also be part of an Active
Directory domain.
Samba can be used with Linux to provide transparent access between systems running Linux and systems
running Windows. Samba itself runs on a Linux system and makes shared files and printers available to
Windows system, as if they are available on a Window system or server.
